tourism revenue no tevenly distributed. there are variations.

our interest is where they are located. spatial dsitribution.

look into where are the hotspots, spatial autocorrelation, where are the clusters, outliers,

we want to see the tynamic of it. we want to know which one changed most significantly over time and how we classified them.

we are looking at key indicators of tourism economy. it's NOT 1 only. there are more than 1 indicators.

like , total revenue, is 1 indicator. see if there are any others.

if tourism economy is dependent on space and time, we wanna find cluster, outlier, hotspot and coldspot.

data, province level, incl. bangkok. we used it before. we only need the province level. just one.
