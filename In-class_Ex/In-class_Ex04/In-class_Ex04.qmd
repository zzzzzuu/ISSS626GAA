# Geographically weighted summary statistics, gwModel methods

bw.gwr is the method to recommend the bandwidth to cut off, or if using adaptive distance, the optimal number of neighbours to get statistifically signifant insights as much as possible.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, spdep, tmap, tidyverse, knitr, GWmodel, ggstatsplot)


hunan_sf <- st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", 
                 layer = "Hunan")
hunan2012 <- read_csv("data/aspatial/Hunan_2012.csv") #read_csv is better
hunan_sf <- left_join(hunan_sf, hunan2012) %>%
  dplyr::select(1:3, 7, 15, 16, 31, 32)


```
